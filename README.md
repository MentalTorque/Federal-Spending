# Federal-Spending
An analysis of federal spending by agency and geographic location.

Project is an example of trying to to develop an understanding of federal spending based on 2017 data to determine spending by agency and geographic locations!  

***

I am trying to build a model that will predict funding for federal agencies dependent on agency and geographical location.

This is designed to benefit primarily the Department of Energy, but other federal agencies will be able to use it as well.

Model 3 is presently the most accurate model, though it's r2 value is .28.  It is a Linear Regression with 5 hidden layers, l2 regularization, 5 hidden layers (2 Sigmois, 3 ReLU), and Linear on the last activation.

Others can be generated to improve accuracy.  These will be investigated in the future as I continue to refine this project.
